# Eye-Movement-Computer-Vision-Project
The project describes an AI-powered, camera driven screening system utilizes eye movements and saccades to detect early signs of Parkinson's disease. Using computer vision, the system captures eye movements via web interface. The data is collected and processed for disease prediction in a ML model. This could be used as preliminary screening tool.
